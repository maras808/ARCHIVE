## About this repository

**This is an <ins>archival</ins> repository.** The code here was written without tests, version control, or consideration for production environments. This repository serves as a record of my past projects, containing a mix of scripts, applications, and experiments. All projects included are purely experimental and were created to explore ideas, learn new technologies, or test concepts. Most of the code is kept here to remind me of **what not to do** and **does not represent my current coding standards or best practices.**


## Why this repository exists

I decided to make these projects public to:

- **Avoid bad practices** by referencing older code and remembering quirks.
- **Document my growth** as a developer and reflect on my earliest experiences with Next.js.
- **Preserve** these projects for personal reference and historical purposes.


## Limitations of the code

Please note the following:

- **Not production-ready**: These projects are <ins>highly experimental</ins> and should not be used in production environments. Many of them likely won't build due to ESLint or TypeScript errors.
- **Outdated practices**: Most of the approaches and technologies used here are no longer aligned with modern best practices.
- **Invalid or expired data**: Any sensitive data, such as API keys, database credentials, or tokens, included in the code is either invalid, expired, or purely placeholder.
